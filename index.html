        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Lewis Hamilton is a British racing driver who has made history as the first Formula 1 driver of color. Born on January 7, 1985, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton has become one of the most successful and influential figures in the sport. He began his career in karting at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks, showcasing his exceptional talent and determination. In 2007, he made his Formula 1 debut with McLaren, finishing third in his first race and narrowly missing out on the championship that year. In 2008, he won his first World Championship, becoming the youngest ever world champion at that time. Hamilton has since joined Mercedes and dominated the sport, equaling Michael Schumacher's record of seven World Championships. Beyond his on-track achievements, Hamilton is known for his advocacy for diversity and inclusion within motorsport, using his platform to promote social justice and environmental causes. His groundbreaking career and activism have solidified his legacy as a trailblazer and role model both on and off the track.</p>
